# Forecast-the-Worldwide-Burden-of-Mental-Health
This dissertation uses explainable machine learning to forecast the global burden of mental health disorders using sociodemographic indicators, particularly the Human Development Index. Longitudinal data (1990–2022) are analysed using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to support transparent, policy-relevant prediction.
